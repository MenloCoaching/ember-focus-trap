# Arguments

## focusTrapOptions

Type: Object, optional

Pass any of the options available in focus-trap's createOptions. [See
documentation](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap#focustrap--createfocustrapelement-createoptions).

## isActive
Type: Boolean, optional

By default, the FocusTrap activates when the element renders.
So you activate and deactivate it by the live cycle of element.
If, however, you want to control when FocusTrap is activated or deactivated,
you can use this option.

## isPaused
Type: Boolean, optional

If you would like to pause or unpause the focus trap (see [focus-trap's documentation](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap#focustrappause)), toggle this argument.
